Description: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput
    sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the premier technology for profiling genome-wide
    localization of chromatin-binding proteins, including transcription
    factors and histones with various modifications.
    This package provides a robust method for normalizing ChIP-seq
    signals across individual samples or groups of samples. It also designs
    a self-contained system of statistical models for calling differential
    ChIP-seq signals between two or more biological conditions as well as
    for calling hypervariable ChIP-seq signals across samples. Refer to
    Tu et al. (2021) <doi:10.1101/gr.262675.120> and
    Chen et al. (2021) <doi:10.1101/2021.07.27.453915>
    for associated statistical details.

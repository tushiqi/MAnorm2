Description: MAnorm2 provides a robust method for normalizing ChIP-seq signals
    across individual samples or groups of samples. It also designs a
    self-contained system of statistical models for calling differential
    ChIP-seq signals between two or more biological conditions as well as
    for calling hypervariable ChIP-seq signals across samples.
